## Game Rules
<p>Candy Crush is a single player game where players swap pieces of colored candy on a board to make a combination of three, four or five identical colors in a row or column. It is possible to exchange a piece of place with those around it. Scoring is done using these combinations. When this happens, the combined candies are crushed and a new random combination is generated.<br>
<p>The objective of this game is to achieve the defined score. There are two options for game modes: Play Timer and Play Moves. In the timer, there is a time limit for making the combinations. And in moves, there is a movement limit. When this limit is exhausted, it is possible to know if you won or lost by the message that will appear on the screen.

## Installing
<p>You can run it offline by downloading/cloning the project files or you can run my online instance from [here](https://michaloumen.github.io/projeto-1-game/)
