# Project #1

# Family Memories

This is my first coding project as part of the IronHack bootcamp. It's a game called **Family Memories** and it's just like a regular _memory game_ but using pictures of loved children from my family.

## Game rules

1. Cards will be mixed up
2. All cards face down
3. Player turn over any two cards
   - If the two cards match we keep them, if more than one player the player turn remains
   - If they don't match, we turn them back over, if more than one player then it's the next player's turn
4. Remember what was on each card and where it was
5. The game is over when all the cards have been matched
6. The player checks how many attempts were needed
7. The player with higher number of guesses wins
8. If the number of guesses match between players then it's a tie

## Prerequisites

No real prerequisites, just use your **browser**, game is using standard _HTML, CSS and JavaScript_.

## Installing

You can run it offline by downloading/cloning the project files or you can run my online instance from [GitHub Pages](https://leomezza.github.io/FamilyMemories-IH-Mod1/)

If you want to customize the game with your own family pictures firstly download/clone the the project, then just throw the image files inside **img** folder and edit the constant array _family_ from _js/script.js_ with the family members names which must match the filenames from the pictures.

Example:

```javascript
const family = ["Romeo", "Juliet", "John", "Mary"];
```

**img** folder must have correspondent files _Romeo.jpg, Juliet.jpg, John.jpg, Mary.jpg_ inside it.
